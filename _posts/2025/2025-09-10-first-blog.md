Starting my computer science writing and all the things I learn along the way. I figure, why not write it and look back on it to see how much progress i've made but also practice my technical writing skills and knowledge. 

I hope to improve my engineering skills and really take the time to learn computer science and eventually get my Masters in Computer Science from Georgia Tech (OMSCS). I have taken 3 courses in computer science so far. Introduction to C++, Intermediate C++ and currently taking Data Structures & Algorithms using C++. So far, it's been a challenge and a good one at that. Learning a lot about memory allocation, memory management, Classes and objects, what makes C++ great and not so great. 

A lot of freedom to do what you need to do without the compiler throwing an error at you. But just because something gives you so much freedom, doesn't mean it's a good thing. I guess this is why they say C++ is memory-unsafe. And if you allocated memory, you better deallocate it.

I still don't know how to structure my tech blog or treat it as some freestyle blog, where I write whatever and whenever...It would be nice to have structure, but sometimes having structure can be overwhelming...I guess we will find out...
